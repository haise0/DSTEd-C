## The Gist of Things
I revived this project because I wanted a GUI editor for DST mods. The official tools from Steam and Klei are okay, but I wanted something more integrated within itself for editing. Mod creation will likely still require the official Steam DST mod tools (Steam > Library > Tools > Don't Starve Mod Tools) but as far as editing goes, I just disliked having to toss everything back and forth. 

I found DSTEd first, and then DSTEd-C, and was sad to see it abandoned. I seem to have gotten this thing back into working order for now - it runs and integrates pretty well with all of the files in a mod, although PNGs will crash the application `(todo)`.

## Contribute
If you want to contribute please do so, because I am a bit new to C#. Intuition can only carry me so far and I'm pretty inexperienced, so I can always use the help.

`(todo)` The Discord Server I've created as a communication pool can be found here.

Please see the original project's [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7MgGxkB) here.

For the development process I'm using Jetbrains Rider 2021.1.3. The original project was created using Visual Studio 2017 CE. You can download that from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/) for free. Newer VSCode versions will probably work fine but I can't exactly guarantee that.

You can also support me by [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/haise0). I don't have income at the moment so every drop of caffeine helps!
